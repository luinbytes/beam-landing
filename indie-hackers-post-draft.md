🚀 Milestone: Landing page live for contractor quoting SaaS - validation approach critique wanted

---

## Post Body

Hey IH community,

After years of open source projects, I'm finally building something revenue-focused.

**The Problem:** UK contractors spend 20-30 minutes typing quotes in Word. Then customers ghost because emails get buried.

**The Solution:** Beam - create professional quotes in 60 seconds from your phone, send via SMS, track views.

**Current Status:**
✅ Landing page built (with email capture)
✅ Value proposition defined
✅ 0/30 early access signups (just started)
⬜ MVP build (waiting for validation)

**My Validation Approach:**
1. Landing page with email capture (Formspree → inbox)
2. 50% off launch pricing for early signups
3. Target: 30+ signups before building MVP
4. Channels: Direct email, Facebook groups, LinkedIn, Reddit

**Questions for IH:**
- Is 30 signups a reasonable threshold?
- Should I build MVP in parallel or wait?
- Any feedback on the landing page?
- Better channels for UK tradespeople?

First time doing customer validation "properly" - appreciate any feedback!

## Key Points to Emphasize in Comments

- Target market: UK contractors (plumbers, electricians, builders)
- USP: SMS delivery (98% open rate vs 20% email)
- Price: $29/mo at launch, $15/mo for early birds
- Competition: Jobber, Housecall Pro (but they're expensive and complex)
- Why this matters: Tradespeople value time, not features
