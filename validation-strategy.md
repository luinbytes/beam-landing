**Success Metric:** 20 upvotes, 2-3 signups (different ICP but network effects)

**Strategy:**

**Success Metric:** 100 views, 2-4 signups

**Risk:** Wrong audience (tech-focused)

**Success Metric:** 50 subscribers, 0-2 target customers

#### 9. Twitter/X Threads

## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email Template

Subject: Quick question about your quoting process

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're running [trade type] services in [area] - great reviews on Google!

I'm building a tool called Beam to help UK contractors create professional quotes in under 60 seconds from their phone. The idea came from watching tradespeople struggle with paperwork after a long day on site.

Key features:
• Create quotes in 60 seconds (not 30 minutes in Word)
• Send via SMS (customers actually open them)
• Track when quotes are viewed
• Branded PDFs automatically

I'm looking for 20 contractors to try it early and give feedback. In return, you'd get 50% off launch pricing ($15/mo instead of $29).

No obligation - just thought it might save you time.

Interested? Early access signup: https://luinbytes.github.io/beam-landing/

Happy to chat if you have questions.

Cheers,
Lu
Builder of Beam

P.S. If this isn't relevant, feel free to ignore. No hard feelings!

🎯 Building something for UK contractors - need your help

After talking to dozens of tradespeople, I kept hearing the same pain point:

"Quoting takes forever. 30 minutes in Word, then customers ghost."

So I'm building Beam - professional quotes in 60 seconds from your phone.

🔧 What it does:
• Quick quotes (tap, type, send)
• SMS delivery (better open rates)
• View tracking (know when they've seen it)
• Branded PDFs

🚀 Status: Building now, collecting early access signups

💰 Offer: Early birds get 50% off launch pricing

If you're a UK contractor (plumber, electrician, handyman, builder), I'd love your feedback:

Hey everyone,

Not selling anything - just building something and need honest feedback.

I'm creating a tool called Beam to help tradespeople create quotes faster. The idea is:
- 60 second quotes from your phone
- Send via SMS (people actually read texts)
- Track when customers view your quote
- Professional PDFs with your branding

Currently building it, collecting early access signups before I invest more time.

Early signups get 50% off when it launches.

If this sounds useful: https://luinbytes.github.io/beam-landing/

What I'd love to know:
- What's your current quoting process like?
- Would you actually use SMS delivery or is email still king?
- What features would make this a no-brainer for you?

Be brutal - I'd rather build something useful than waste everyone's time.

Thanks in advance!

```
🚀 Milestone: Built landing page for contractor quoting SaaS, starting validation

Hey IH community,

After years of open source projects, I'm finally building something revenue-focused.

**The Problem:** UK contractors spend 20-30 minutes typing quotes in Word. Then customers ghost because emails get buried.

**The Solution:** Beam - create professional quotes in 60 seconds from your phone, send via SMS, track views.

**Current Status:**
✅ Landing page built (with email capture)
✅ Value proposition defined
✅ 0/30 early access signups (just started)
⬜ MVP build (waiting for validation)

**My Validation Approach:**
1. Landing page with email capture (Formspree → inbox)
2. 50% off launch pricing for early signups
3. Target: 30+ signups before building MVP
4. Channels: Direct email, Facebook groups, LinkedIn

**Questions for IH:**
- Is 30 signups a reasonable threshold?
- Should I build MVP in parallel or wait?
- Any feedback on the landing page?

**Link:** https://luinbytes.github.io/beam-landing/

First time doing customer validation "properly" - appreciate any feedback!

Subject: Building a quoting tool for tradespeople - need feedback

Hi all,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I'm building a tool called Beam to help UK tradespeople create professional quotes faster.

The concept:
- Create quotes in 60 seconds from your phone
- SMS delivery (higher open rates than email)
- Track when customers view your quote
- Automatic branded PDFs

I'm NOT selling anything yet - still building. Collecting early access signups to validate demand before investing more time.

Early signups get 50% off launch pricing: https://luinbytes.github.io/beam-landing/

What I'd really appreciate:
- Does this solve a real pain point for you?
- What's your current quoting process?
- What features am I missing?

Thanks in advance for any feedback!
```

## Notes & Learnings

### Key Insights from Research

**From Indie Hackers validation guides:**
- Customer interviews are gold - but need access
- Pre-selling (collecting payments) is strongest validation
- 30 signups is reasonable threshold for MVP build
- Landing page + payment form is fastest validation loop

**From UK trades research:**
- Tradespeople value time over features
- SMS is preferred for quick communication
- Reviews and reputation drive decisions
- Facebook groups are active community hubs
- Screwfix forum has engaged tradespeople

**Common pain points mentioned:**
- "Quoting takes too long"
- "Customers don't respond to emails"
- "Paperwork eats into evening time"
- "Don't know if they've seen my quote"

### SaaS Validation Best Practices

1. **Customer interviews > surveys** (but need access first)
2. **Smoke test with landing page** (we have this ✓)
3. **Pre-sell if possible** (we're offering discount, not pre-payment)
4. **Wait for strangers to sign up** (friends don't count)
5. **One stranger paying > 100 friends saying "cool idea"**

## Alternative: Partner Outreach

If direct channels don't work, consider partnerships:

| Potential Partner | Type | Approach |
|-------------------|------|----------|
| Trade Mastermind | Training community | Offer free tool to their members |
| Checkatrade | Directory | Feature in their newsletter (paid?) |
| Local trade colleges | Education | Offer to students starting out |
| Tool suppliers | Retail | Partner for customer referrals |

---

## Next Actions

1. **Lu to join Reddit** and post the existing drafts
2. **Execute Tier 1 channels** (direct email, Facebook, LinkedIn)
3. **Track signups daily** - update this doc
4. **Iterate messaging** based on responses
5. **Consider MVP parallel build** if validation shows promise
