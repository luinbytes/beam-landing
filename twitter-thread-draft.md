## Thread Option 1: Build in Public Journey

1/6
I've spent years building open source projects. Now I'm finally building something revenue-focused.

The problem? UK contractors spend 20-30 minutes typing quotes in Word. Then customers ghost.

So I'm building Beam.

2/6
Beam = professional quotes in 60 seconds from your phone.

• Quick tap-to-create quotes
• SMS delivery (people actually read texts)
• View tracking (know when they've seen it)
• Automatic branded PDFs

3/6
Current status:
✅ Landing page built
✅ Value proposition defined
⬜ MVP in progress

Collecting early access signups before I invest more time building.

Early birds get 50% off launch pricing.

4/6
The idea came from watching tradespeople struggle with paperwork after a long day on site.

They're exhausted. They want to go home. But they have 3 quotes to write up.

What if that took 3 minutes instead of 90?

5/6
If you're a UK contractor (plumber, electrician, builder, handyman), I'd love your feedback:

What's your biggest quoting headache?

6/6
Following the "build in public" approach - will share updates as I go.

If this resonates, drop a comment or sign up for early access.

## Thread Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

1/4
Why do contractors hate quoting?

I asked 20+ tradespeople. The answers were consistent:

• "Takes too long" (20-30 min in Word)
• "Customers don't respond"
• "I don't know if they've seen my quote"
• "It eats into my evening"

2/4
So I'm building Beam - quotes in 60 seconds from your phone.

The killer feature? SMS delivery.

Text messages have 98% open rates. Emails? 20% if you're lucky.

3/4
Early access now open for UK contractors:
• Plumbers
• Electricians
• Builders
• Handypeople
• Any trade that sends quotes

50% off launch pricing for early signups.

## Thread Option 3: Short & Punchy

1/2
Building a tool for UK contractors to create quotes in 60 seconds from their phone.

• SMS delivery (better open rates)
• View tracking (know when they've seen it)
• Branded PDFs

Early access: https://luinbytes.github.io/beam-landing/

50% off for early birds.

2/2
Target: 30 early access signups before building full MVP.

If you're a plumber, electrician, builder, or handyman in the UK - I need your feedback.

What's the most annoying part of your quoting process?
